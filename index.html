<h1>kth dh2321 ivis17 project 2, by yiming fan</h1>
<h4>19/2/2016</h4>
<h2>introduction</h2>
<h3>this project visualizes the sexual equality progresses and health / sanitation status of countries all over the world.</h3>
<h2>how to play</h2>
<h3>select different questions, then select time periods w.r.t. scores to the questions.</h3>
<h2>how data are visualized?</h2>
<h3>every country has a score to the quetion at a certain time period, which is mapped to a certain color. usually a 'time period' contains data of the past five years. the darker, the better the country does in this aspect.</h3>
<h3>due to time limit only 30 countries are sampled on the map.</h3>
<h2>sexual equality status over 30 countries</h2>
